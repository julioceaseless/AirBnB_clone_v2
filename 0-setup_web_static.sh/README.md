## ALX::0x03. AirBnB clone - Deploy static
This is the first deployment project of the AirBnB project. We start with deploying the `webstatic` work. We utilize `Fabric` tool (for Python3) to streamline the use of SSH for application deployment and system administration tasks.

By completing this project, we demonstrate understanding of:
- What is Fabric
- How to deploy code to a server easily
- What is a tgz archive
- How to execute Fabric command locally
- How to execute Fabric command remotely
- How to transfer files with Fabric
- How to manage Nginx configuration
- What is the difference between root and alias in a Nginx configuration
